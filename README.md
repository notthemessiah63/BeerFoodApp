# BeerFoodApp
MVP

Overview:
========
Develop an app for a user to review pairing of beer to food. If time allows, I hope to add Reviews of the promoted information. A further enhancement would be to allow users to add beers and foods that they have paired, and add their comments. I feel this will be outside the scope of this project due to time constraints.


MVP Scope:
==========
The app will allow the user to select a beer style (or all) from a select menu.
Beers will be listed showing limited attributes. 
Selecting a beer from the listing will show on same/different page with further attributes and a list of food/s recommended to be eaten with the beer will be presented.

Talking with friends and storyboarding changed my personal view of how this app should unfold for the user, so I changed the development to match how the majority of users would see this working. If time allows I would like to allow the app to be accessed through both viewpoints.

Scope (after review)
================
The app will allow the user to select a food style (or all) from a select menu.
Food styles will be listed showing limited attributes. 
Selecting a food from the listing will take the user to a new page Giving Information about the food selected. a list of beers recommended to be eaten with the food will be presented with limited attributes

Selecting a beer will show further attributes including tasting notes


Future Enhancements:
=================
Enhancement 1 - The pairing presented will may have have a site rating including star rating review notes and who reviewed it

Enhancement 2 - A provision to be made for a site visitor to select a food and beer pairing and add their own review/rating.

Enhancement 5 - A provision to be made for someone to add their own beer entity and food entity and pairing them adding a review.

Intermediate Enhancement: Fit in Additional information content with groovy information and snippets about brewing/beer and food pairings.
